# super-capsule
This is a 3D game that allows user to collect coins, dodge enemies, and go to finish line.
Basically a 3D super Mario, but the player is a capsule.

This is a project for learning basic Unity 3D, the idea and code belong to the tutorial video on youtube.

I only changed some parts of level design and made a 3d model with blender. 

The game currently contains start scene, two levels and an end scene, I might add more levels one day.
